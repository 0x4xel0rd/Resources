Here is a list of a few cryptology books, papers and courses that could potentially be useful.

- *An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography*, Hoffstein, Pipher, Silverman

Link: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-77993-5

Level: beginner

This book can be seen as a reference for anyone who wants to discover cryptology in great details. It goes from very basic topics in cryptology (substitution ciphers, modular arithmetic, RSA) up to some advanced concepts (elliptic curve cryptography, lattices). A lot of exercises are present so that the reader can get familiar with all of those topics. Its content has to be masterized before considering reading any of the resources below.

- *A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory*, Henri Cohen

Link: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-02945-9

Level: intermediary

A very complete view of all the classical number theoretic algorithms used in cryptology (factorization, lattices, elliptic curves). A great reference book in case you forgot how an algorithm you use is working. Contains many exercises.

- *Twenty Years of Attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem*, Dan Boneh

Link: https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/RSA-survey.pdf

Level: intermediary

A survey of the different attacks on RSA parameters, from very basic ones (relying on an "easy" factorization of the RSA modulus) to more advanced ones. For a more detailed work, one can also give a look at Durfee's PhD thesis (http://theory.stanford.edu/~gdurf/durfee-thesis-phd.pdf).

- *A Gentle Tutorial for Lattice-Based Cryptanalysis*, Surin, Cohney

Link: https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/032.pdf

Level: intermediary

Applications of lattice reduction to cryptanalysis.

- *Post-quantum cryptography*, Bernstein, Buchmann, Dahmen

Link: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-88702-7

Level: advanced

Different algorithms related to post-quantum cryptography (excepted isogeny-based cryptography).

- *Mathematics of Isogeny Based Cryptography*, Luca de Feo

Link: https://github.com/defeo/MathematicsOfIBC/blob/popayan-temp/poly.pdf

Level: advanced

The main things to know about isogeny based cryptography.
